    "**A. Describe the purpose of this data mining report by doing the following:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Propose one question relevant to a real-world organizational situation that you will answer by using principal component analysis (PCA).**\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical component in patient relationship management is understanding the conditions leading to hospital admissions. When a hospital is able to better understand its patients’ characteristics, they are able to target treatment to patients, resulting in more effective cost of care for the hospital in the long term.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, the research questions is **what are the key principal components of the dataset?** This analysis will use PCA to analyze the medical data to identify the principal variables of the hospital's patients, ultimately allowing better business and strategic decision-making for the hospital.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Define one goal of the data analysis. Ensure that your goal is reasonable within the scope of the scenario and is represented in the available data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the data analysis is to reduce the dimensions of the data set while retaining the information found in the dataframe. This is one of the main objectives of principal component analysis and this is the main goal of the data analysis that will be conducted in this performance assessment.\n",

    "In the context of our research question, the goal is the reduce the number of variables while retaining the information in our dataset. We are looking to inform what are the key components of predicting readmission when looking at the hospital dataset."

    "**B. Explain the reasons for using PCA by doing the following:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Explain how PCA analyzes the selected data set. Include expected outcomes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a technique used to analyze and transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the most important patterns and structures of the original data. It achieves this by finding a new set of principal components that capture the maximum variance in the data (Loukas, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps involved in PCA analysis are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Standardization\n",
    "* Compute Covariance Matrix: PCA involves calculating the covariance matrix of the standardized data. The covariance matrix measures the relationships between each pair of features, indicating how they vary together or move independently.\n",
    "* Compute Eigenvalues: The eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance\n",
    "* Select Principal Components: Select the significant principal components\n",
    "\n",
    "(Loukas, 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "A few expected outcomes of PCA analysis are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduced Dimensionality: PCA reduces the number of dimensions (features) in the data, providing a lower-dimensional representation of the original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explained Variance: Each principal component's corresponding eigenvalue indicates the amount of variance explained by that component. The sum of all eigenvalues represents the total variance explained by all the principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Summarize one assumption of PCA.**\n",
    "\n",
    "One assumptions of PCA is that PCA assumes that the relationships between variables in the dataset are linear. This entails that a change in one variable is proportional to the changes in the other variables. If the relationships are highly nonlinear, PCA might not accurately capture the underlying structure. (Loukas, 2020)."

    "Initially, we started with 18 continuous variables from our dataset. Our research goal for this performance assessment was to reduce the dimensions of the dataset while retaining as much as variance as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the analysis, we scaled the data and conducted PCA to all 18 variables that explained 100% of the variance. Then we were able to reduce the principal components down to 7 to explain 63.2% variance of the data. We used the Kaiser criterion for the variable reduction as the scree plot did not show a significant elbow. The Kaiser criterion suggests to remove variables that have an eigenvalue less than 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "The findings of this analysis is that we are able to reduce our dataset from 18 key principals to 7 key principals while maintaining 63.2% of the variance. In an ideal situation, we would have a scree plot with a prominent elbow and a higher variance of the principal components. However, perfect data is not a realistic expection when analyzing real world data. In this situation, I would either suggest the hospital to consider collecting additional numerical data from patients in the hospital to  help improve the variance of the data. Additionally, if the hospital is content with 63.2% variance, I would strongly suggest the hospital to accept the PCA conducted below. I would consider a reduction of 11 variables while maintaining > 60% of the variance quite successful, especially considering that we are working with real world data."
